#Movie Recommendation System

Introduction
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System repository! This project aims to provide users  with personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and viewing history.
The system utilizes collaborative filtering algorithms to suggest relevant movies, enhancing the overall user experience and engagement on movie streaming platforms.

How it Works
The Movie Recommendation System employs collaborative filtering, a popular technique in recommender systems. Collaborative filtering relies on user behaviour, 
such as movie ratings and viewing history, to identify similar users and recommend movies based on their preferences. 
The system also takes advantage of item-based filtering, where movies with similar characteristics are recommended to users who have shown interest in a particular movie.

Key Features
User Profiles: Users can create profiles and rate movies they have watched, helping the system understand their preferences better.
Movie Ratings: The system allows users to rate movies they have seen, contributing to the collaborative filtering process.
Top Picks: The system will display a list of top movie recommendations based on various factors, such as user ratings, trending movies, and personalized interests.
Search and Filters: Users can search for specific movies or apply filters to find recommendations from particular genres, actors, or release years.
User Engagement: The recommendation system aims to keep users engaged with the platform by continually providing relevant and exciting movie suggestions.
